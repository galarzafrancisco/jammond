> It's all about the feel bro.

I want a Hammond organ. I want it to have a killer sound. I want it to be portable. I want it to feel great. I want it to not have any screens or LEDs or anything digital about it. I want it to feel like the real thing. And I don't want it to break the bank.

What I want doesn't exist, so I'll make it.

- Killer sound: I won't reinvent the (tone)wheel (yet!) so I'll use something like VB3m which sounds great and runs on an old iPhone I have lying around. Sound engine: done âœ…
- Great feel: I'll make a wooden cabinet replicating the layout of a Hammond B3, but for a single manual. There will be no lights or screens. What you see is what you get.
- Keys: a Fatar keybed with 61 waterfall organ style keys will be donated by a Studiologic VMK 161 Organ Plus. This should provide the right feel (except fast triggering, I might need to replace the controller to trigger on the first sensor like a Roland VR-09)
- Controllers: if it's a Hammond it needs drawbars. Good ones. Clicky ones. I bought a D9X controller kit from Crumar. They feel great. I might not use the full kit and just use the drawbar bit. We'll see. I will try to source great switches to match the look and feel of the real B3 for percussion / vibrato.

# Repo structure

### Code
Mostly contains Arduino code for ESP32 MCUs, but there are some React apps to tweak parameters too.

### Electronics
Things like schematics and PCBs.
