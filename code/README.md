# Jammond

## Controller
Contains code to read drawbars, buttons, pots, take MIDI input from the keyboard module, and output a combined MIDI signal.

## Tonewheel
Contains code related to generating the Hammond sound. This is just for fun, a POC at best. Sound will actually come from a good quality software like VB3.

## Leslie
Same as above.
